# mycelyso-inspector

Last commit before submission was 88d5976548478541e3b3bdb028304e123a74c70f

A bug was found, which made packages incompatible with most Windows systems.

As of 2017-05-31, a new wheel has been pushed to PyPI. (mycelyso_inspector-0.0.1rc4-py3-none-any.whl)

Furthermore, due to purepng dependency, it is advisable to use Python 3.5 instead of Python 3.6 (as of now).

This is the Python/HTML5 based webinterface to inspect [mycelyso](https://github.com/modsim/mycelyso) Datasets.
